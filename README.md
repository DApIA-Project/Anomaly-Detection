# Anomaly-Detection
Deep learning approach to detect anomaly in ADS-B data.


## Experiment 1: (In progress)

Aircraft classification based on type (Commercial planes, Tourism plane, Helicopter ...).
The goal of this approach is to prevent "spoofing" attack by to detecting if the icao/callsing of an aircraft is correcponding to his trajectory.
